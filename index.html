                        This is a video of a crab eating a potato chip. There are many videos on the internet of crabs eating snacks, but this one is a particularly provocative video for me, mainly because I also love potato chips.

                        The above video is an interview of Paul and Pru of the Great British Bakeoff trying American snacks. It makes my top pics because their favorites align with my own, including Pru's controversial opinion on Oreo's.

                        A masterpiece from start to finish, Rita's Workout Video is so much more than a workout video. Also, it's not a workout video.

                        This video was very scary to search for, because I could only remember the key words "screaming monster", "stilts", and "fried eggs".
